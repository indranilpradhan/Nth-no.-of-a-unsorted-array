# Nth-no.-of-a-unsorted-array

To find the nth smallest element in a given sequence. The operation should take
an amortized cost of O(n).
Aim: To learn how to use randomization in algorithms.
Hint: Think of the partition function of randomized quick-sort.
Testing: Time your function using time.h and compare it with the Standard Library Function
nth_element().
